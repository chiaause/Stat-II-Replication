## 1. Summary

<!--In this section, you are expected to provide a summary of the paperâ€™s research question and main findings, as well as a detailed critical assessment of the causal identification strategy employed by the authors.-->


## 2. Reproduction of paper's table or figure

<!--In this section, you are expected to reproduce a table or figure from the paper relating to the modeling of the outcome(s) of interest.-->

```{r}
# Please make sure we can see all code and output here
```


## 3. Extension

<!--In this section, you are expected to present an extension to the analysis from the paper. Additionally, you should provide a detailed justification of your extension and its potential contribution.-->

```{r}
# Calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles of log population density
percentiles <- quantile(rdd_data$log_pop_density, c(0.25, 0.75))

# Assign categories based on percentile thresholds
rdd_data$pop_density_factor <- with(rdd_data, ifelse(log_pop_density < percentiles[1], "1-Low",
                                                     ifelse(log_pop_density < percentiles[2], "2-Medium", "3-High")))

# Convert to factor and specify the levels for ordered display
rdd_data$pop_density_factor <- factor(rdd_data$pop_density_factor, levels = c("1-Low", "2-Medium", "3-High"))

# Create histogram
ggplot(rdd_data, aes(x = pop_density_factor)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = pop_density_factor), stat = "count") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Population Density Categories",
       x = "Population Density Category",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Category") +
  theme_minimal()
```
